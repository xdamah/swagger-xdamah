### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

swagger-xdamah is a spring boot and swagger extension for creating REST services.  
Its similar to Design first, works with Code First and Design First and yet a different third approach.  
Its aim is to reduce boiler plate controller code whether handwritten or generated and rather rely on swagger specs only for same purpose.  
It is hoped that the many new concepts here will eventually affect the existing traditional approaches.  
If facing any difficulties or have feedback please inform using the issue tracker.   


**swagger-xdamah** is demonstrated here https://github.com/xdamah/swagger-xdamah-examples .

Its features are listed here :

- ðŸ”­ Minimalises generated code.  Generates only the model code ... ...

- ðŸ’¬ Mixing code-first, design first and xdamah is possible ...
- ðŸ“« Reuse of parameter definitions. ...
- ðŸ˜„ For the same model its much easier to support requests in multiple media types - json, xml, form, multipart as swagger request ...
